# GRPutils

This repository contains utilities to manipulate Artemis compatable coverage **gr**a**p**hs (denote *.grp format), which can be visualized using Artemis. 

* `wig2grp.py`: convert Wiggle files generated by `bam2wig.py` from the RseQC package to grp format.  
* `merge_grp.py`: given a list of grp files from the same genome, this script will average/add-up the coverage at each genome coordinate, then return a new grp file.
